# UGA_maps
Data and code related to making maps for the University of Georgia. You are welcome to check out the code and reproduce what you like. This is a work in progress. I am primarily focused using RStudio to extract data from OSM, manipulate the data, and then create .shp files for use in ArcGIS.

Feel free to request more features or abilities.
