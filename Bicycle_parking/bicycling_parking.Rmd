This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

```{r}

library(rgeos)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}

FYI all osmdata object can be combined using the c() operator. This c() operation can only be performed on simple feature (sf) type geographic features. I.e. you have to use osmdata_sf() to create the simple feature or convert sp type features to sf type features. I think that calling the bbox based on the county perimeter is better. There are some campuses that are not labeled only "University of Georgia" explicity, so it may be best to use st_... methods to get landuse polygons based on the UGA operator key and then use those polygons to filter and select UGA buildings. I could also use the trim_osmdata() function to select from the list of all UGA operated landuse polygons and run through them, one-by-one and obtain a building list that way. I need to use format_out = "polygon" in the getbb() function in order for this to work. There may be some edge-cases (e.g. building is on UGA campus landuse polygon, yet is not a UGA operated building.) that lead me to think that simply adding operator="University of Georgia" to each building is worth the effort.

Pro-tip: value_exact needs to be false in order for match_case to also be false and not fail the query.

```{r}
bb_county <- getbb('Athens-Clarke County')
all_Buildings <- opq(bbox = bb_county) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "building") %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "operator", value = "University of Georgia", value_exact = FALSE, match_case = FALSE) %>%
  osmdata_sf()
all_Buildings <- all_Buildings$osm_polygons
```

```{r}
ugaCampus <- opq(bbox = bb_county) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "landuse", value = "property") %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "name", value = "University of Georgia", value_exact = FALSE, match_case = FALSE) %>%
  osmdata_sf()
#Create sf dataset of the UGA campus polygons.
ugaCampus <- ugaCampus$osm_polygons
```

This query allows me to access the multipolygon that comprises the UGA campus. I will then use this to create a bbox based on this multipolygon. I need to also filter out only the polygons from this multipolygon that are explicitly labeled as universities (i.e. amenity = university).

```{r}
ugaCampus <- ugaCampus %>% filter(amenity == "university")
```


Get all bicycle parking features in Athens. There are, I believe, at least two  bicycle parking features mapped as polygons, so in order for a completely accurate bike parking count, I need to include them. It may cause some issues downstream.

```{r}
all_Bicycle_Nodes <- opq(bbox =bb_county) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "amenity", value = "bicycle_parking") %>%
  osmdata_sf()
all_Bicycle_Nodes <- all_Bicycle_Nodes$osm_points
```

Filter only bicycle nodes within the UGA campus.

```{r}
mat = st_intersects(all_Bicycle_Nodes, ugaCampus, sparse = FALSE)

mat <- apply(mat, 1, any)

all_Bicycle_Nodes_Trimmed <- all_Bicycle_Nodes[mat,]
```

Export the bicycles nodes and UGA buildings as shapefiles.

```{r}
st_write(all_Buildings,
         "UGA_buildings.shp",
         layer_options = "ENCODING=UTF-8",
         delete_layer = TRUE)

st_write(all_Bicycle_Nodes_Trimmed,
         "Bicycle_parking.shp",
         layer_options = "ENCODING=UTF-8",
         delete_layer = TRUE)
```


Combine the UGA bicycle parking and buildings datasets.

```{r}
building_Bike_Combined_Data <- c(all_Buildings, all_Bicycle_Nodes_Trimmed)
```

ggplotly interactive map of UGA buildings and bike racks.

```{r}
q <- ggplot() + geom_sf(data = building_Bike_Combined_Data$osm_points,
  fill = 'light blue') + theme_minimal() + geom_sf(data = building_Bike_Combined_Data$osm_polygons,
  fill = 'light blue') + theme_minimal()
ggplotly()
```
b is building c is bike nodes. Think code is only able to do simple polygons at the time. I will need to add multi-polygon ability in the future.

```{r}
b <- building_Bike_Combined_Data$osm_polygons
c <- building_Bike_Combined_Data$osm_points
```

```{r}
##  First project data into a planar coordinate system (here EPSG:2240)
utmStr <- "+proj=EPSG:2240 +zone=%d +datum=WGS84 +units=ft +no_defs +ellps=GRS80"
crs <- st_crs(2240)

#Perform spatial transform on bike nodes and building polygons
pUTM <- st_transform(b, crs)
ptsUTM <- st_transform(c, crs)
```


```{r}
## Set up containers for results
n <- nrow(ptsUTM)
nearestBuilding <- character(n)
distToNearestBuilding <- numeric(n)
buildingCapacity <- numeric(n)
buildingCount <- numeric(n)
buildingRackType <- character(n)
buildingRackCovered <- character(n)

```

The st_nearest_feature function may also be really useful here. I think I would like to add a column to the original unprojected simple feature type. 
```{r}
## For each point, find name of nearest polygon (in this case, UGA buildings)
for (i in seq_along(nearestBuilding)) {
    buildingCapacity <- ptsUTM$capacity[i,]
    gDists <- st_distance(ptsUTM[i,], pUTM, byid=TRUE)
    nearestBuilding[i] <- pUTM$name[which.min(gDists)]
    distToNearestBuilding[i] <- min(gDists)
}
```
```{r}
## Check that it worked
nearestDistanceName <- data.frame(nearestBuilding, distToNearestBuilding)

#E.g. should return something like this.
#       nearestCanton distToNearestCanton
# 1             Wiltz           15342.222

plot(c, pch=16, col="red")
#text(c, 1:10, pos=3)
plot(b, add=TRUE)
text(b, b$name, cex=0.7)
```

Write the dataframe to a .csv file.

```{r}
write.csv(nearestDistanceName, "Unfinished_nearest_building.csv")
```


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
